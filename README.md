Adds Bootstrap 5 support to Bootstrap select package.

I simply created an NPM package for it.

This package was created by https://github.com/farhadmammadli and Bootstrap select was created by https://github.com/snapappointments/bootstrap-select

You will require jQuery and Bootstrap 5. The package must be imported after both of those.

You can import the JS with ES6 like this;

import 'bootstrap-select-5';

And the CSS like this;

@import "bootstrap-select-5/css/bootstrap-select.min.css";
